Overall good!

I see you are making improvements in regards to trying your hand coding more dynamically!

Now, we should take this to the next level and really get rid of all duplication. You might think it isn't possible, but it is.
Let function do the work for us, and define data structures to faciliate that. Sometimes we can refactor a bit only, but
after having refactored, we see another way to simplify even more. So do just that, try to write more efficient code.
Try to write less code basically, so we can stop having the feeling of filling in tons of text into an excel sheet :D

Next thing to work on would be to structure your files more. Really abstract as much as possible for now.
Validation? New file.
Icons? New file.
Sections of a form? New file.

Everything that can be deemed a section in your code that is self-contained or logically separated from the rest, we want to create a component for it. Especially if that component could be reusable. That makes it way easier to read through your code
and still know what is what after 6 months.
